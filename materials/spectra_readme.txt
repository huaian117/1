# The leaf spectra were created from ASD measurements of leaves from
# each of the species present within the Wytham Woods 6 ha field site
# at the current time (04/04/2018) transmittance values are not present
# however these will be included in future. Each file is the average of
# multiple leaves measured from multiple branches and multiple trees
# within the plot.
#
# The bark spectra was created from ASD measurements and is calculated
# as an average of multiple measurements taken on the trunk of
# different trees of the same species.

# The NA files contain average spectra for all species which are used
# for trees whose species could not be classified from the data
# sources we had available to us.
#
# The understory spectra were also created using multiple measurements
# of the centre of each plot.

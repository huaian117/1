Voxel-based RT simulation:
1. Conduct 3D-explicit RT simulation.
2. After step 1., replace the "input/object_3D.xml" file of 3D-explicit RT simulation with the "object_3D.xml" file in this folder.
3. Create optical properties in "Optical and temperratures properties â†’ Vegetation" in DART simulation editor, for each tree species.
   (e.g., leaf_ACERCA_turbid, wood_ACERCA_turbid).
4. Run DART simulation.

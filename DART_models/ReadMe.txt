# Wytham Woods 3D model for DART

This repository hosts the Wytham Woods 3D scene for DART simulation, with both 3D-explicit model and voxel-based model.
The Wytham Woods 3D model (DART version) represents a one hectare model for a deciduous forest in Wytham, UK. The model contains 559 individual trees, 550 trees inside the one-hectare scene were used. We matched the TLS data with traditional census data to determine the species of each individual tree and allocate species-specific radiometric properties. Full details of the model generation can be found in Liu et al. (2022) and Calders et al. (2018).
